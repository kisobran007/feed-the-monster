Create a 2D game accessory overlay PNG that fits my monster character exactly.

Input I will provide:
- A reference image of the monster character (front view).

Goal:
- Generate ONE accessory overlay image that can be composited directly on top of the monster.
- The overlay must match the monster’s art style, perspective, proportions, and lighting.

Technical requirements:
- Output format: PNG with alpha transparency
- Canvas size: EXACTLY the same as the monster image (do not crop)
- Keep full-canvas alignment (do not shift canvas origin)
- Background must be fully transparent
- No watermark, no text

Important composition rules:
- Accessory only (no monster body parts unless explicitly requested)
- If this is a hat:
  - do NOT include face, body, ears, horns unless I explicitly request horn-compatible design
- Keep details clean and readable at game scale
- Avoid large glow/fog/vignette outside the accessory shape
- Keep edges crisp with natural anti-aliasing

Style constraints:
- Cute/cartoon/fantasy style matching the provided monster
- Similar line quality, saturation, and softness as the character art

Accessory request:
- [WRITE HERE: e.g. “pink winter hat with pom-pom and heart badge”]

Output:
- Return exactly 1 final transparent PNG (same canvas size as input monster image)
